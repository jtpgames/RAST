= Converting Kieker Log Files to Command Log Files and create Database

After performing a load test with TeaStore (for example like xref:Load_Test.adoc[here]), follow these steps to

. convert Kieker log files to command log files,
. create database from command log files:

[NOTE]
In case you have multiple Kieker logs from the same day and want to treat them as separate files, you need to convert them one file at a time. For example, if you want to create prediction and validation data according to xref:../SIGSIM_PADS_2024/README.adoc[our paper at PADS2024], perform the steps below for each file. Start with the log file for the low load intensity profile, convert it and create the database, then remove the log file from the `Kieker_ETL` project. Repeat for each file until you have one database for each log file you acquired.

Steps:

. Download logs (usually a single file with the `.dat` extension) from `http://<teastore-ip>:8081/logs/` (Figs. 1-3).
. Copy the Kieker logs to the `TeaStoreLogs` folder in the `Kieker_ETL` project (create it if necessary).
. Navigate to your `Kieker_ETL` directory:
+
[source,sh]
----
cd <RAST directory>/Kieker_ETL
----
+
. Run `Kieker_ETL`, for example, by executing:
+
[source,sh]
----
./gradlew run --args='TeaStoreLogs'
----
The resulting `.log` files are created in the same folder as the Kieker logs.
. Copy the produced `teastore-cmd_*.log` files to the `TeaStoreLogs` folder in the `ML_ETL` project (create it if necessary). Example:
+
[source,sh]
----
mv teastore-cmd_2024-05-24.log ../../ML_ETL/TeaStoreLogs/
----
. Navigate to your `ML_ETL` directory
+
[source,sh]
----
cd <RAST directory>/ML_ETL
----
+
. (Optional) Create a Python virtual environment and install dependencies:
+
[source,sh]
----
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
----
. Navigate to the log files directory:
+
[source,sh]
----
cd GS/Logfiles/
----
. Convert the command logs using `GSLogConverter.py`, for example, by executing:
+
[source,sh]
----
python GSLogToLocustConverter.py -d ../../TeaStoreLogs/
----
The converted logs are created in the same directory.
. Store everything in the database using `LogToDbETL.py`, for example, by executing:
+
[source,sh]
----
python LogToDbETL.py ../../TeaStoreLogs/
----
The resulting database file is an SQLite database file and is placed in the `db` folder in the `ML_ETL` project.
