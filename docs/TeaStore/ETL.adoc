After performing a load test with TeaStore (see xref:Load_Test.adoc[Load Test]), perform the following to convert kieker log files to command log files:

. Download logs (usually a single file with the `.dat` ending) from `http://<teastore-ip>:8081/logs/` (Figs. 1-3)
. Copy the kieker logs to the `TeaStoreLogs`-folder in the `Kieker_ETL` project (create it, if necessary)
. Run `Kieker_ETL`, e.g., by executing `./gradlew run --args='TeaStoreLogs'`.
The resulting `.log` files are created in the same folder as the kieker logs.
. Copy the produced `teastore-cmd_*.log` to the `TeaStoreLogs`-folder to the ML_ETL project (create it, if necessary).
Example: `mv teastore-cmd_2024-05-24.log ../../ML_ETL/TeaStoreLogs/`
. (Optional) Create a python virtual environment and install dependencies:
.. `python3 -m venv venv`
.. `source venv/bin/activate`
.. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
. `cd GS/Logfiles/`
. Convert the command logs using `GSLogConverter.py`, e.g., by executing `python GSLogToLocustConverter.py -d ../../TeaStoreLogs/`.
The converted logs are created in the same directory.
. Store everything in the database using `LogToDbETL.py`, e.g., by executing `python LogToDbETL.py ../../TeaStoreLogs/`.
The resulting database file is an SQLite Database file and is placed in the `db` folder in the `ML_ETL` project.
