=== Netdata Installation (optional)

`bash <(curl -Ss https://my-netdata.io/kickstart.sh)`

Change netdata.conf to store 21 days of metrics, according to:
<https://learn.netdata.cloud/guides/longer-metrics-storage>

=== Multipass Docker VM Steps (optional)

Create a VM with 6 vCPUs, 8 GB RAM and 100 GB Storage using a cloud-init file for initial setup. After that, copy the docker-compose files and shell scripts, assign execute privileges to the shell scripts and launch the teastore.

* `multipass launch --disk 100G --memory 8G --cpus 6 --name teastore-vm --cloud-init docker-cloud-init-simple.yaml`
* `multipass shell teastore-vm`

To remove it:
* `multipass list` to check the name
* `multipass delete teastore-vm -p` to delete
* `multipass list` to check success

=== Setup TeaStore
==== Building

1. Clone our TeaStore Fork on GitHub: https://github.com/jtpgames/TeaStore/tree/master
2. Build the TeaStore application and the associated Docker images according to the instructions https://github.com/jtpgames/TeaStore/blob/master/GET_STARTED.md#3-building-and-customizing-the-teastore[here] (you can skip steps 1 and 2).

==== Launching

* `chmod +x launch_teastore.sh`
* `chmod +x shutdown_teastore.sh`
* `./launch_teastore.sh`
* When you are done: `./shutdown_teastore.sh`

==== Verification

* (in another shell) multipass list to find the ip address, e.g., 192.168.64.6
* RabbitMQ Dashboard:
** <http://192.168.64.6:15672/#/>
** admin / nimda
* TeaStore:  <http://192.168.64.6:8080>
* Kieker logs: <http://192.168.64.6:8081>
