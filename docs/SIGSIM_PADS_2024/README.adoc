**Last change from: 21.10.2024**

**TODO: Accepted for publication at PADS 2024/TOMACS. Add link.**

In our paper, we explain, implement and evaluate improvements to the following components of RAST:

* Predictive Model Creator,
* Simulator,
* Load Tester.

For our evaluation, we use the https://github.com/DescartesResearch/TeaStore[TeaStore benchmarking application].
We created a GitHub fork <<teastore_fork>> and modified some parameters of their logging framework to create consistent logs especially for higher intensity workloads.

Additional experimental results not published in our paper, including the Python scripts we use for similarity calculation and the validation and prediction data acquired in our experiments, can be accessed in our Datalore notebook <<datalore_notebook>>. It includes instructions, our measurements and the Python code we use for similarity calculation. To access the datalore notebook (similar to a Jupyter notebook) creation of a free account is required.

== Terminology (refer to our paper for details)

=== Training Data
Training data refers to an SQLite database containing predictor and outcome variables extracted from request logs provided by the System Under Evaluation (in our case, TeaStore).

The training data is acquired by running load tests against TeaStore, starting with low load intensity and increasing to high load intensity. The resulting Kieker log file is transformed and stored into an SQLite database, which is then used as training data for predictive modeling. The outcome is a predictive model used by the Simulator.

=== Prediction Data
Prediction data refers to a series of log files produced by the Simulator.

The prediction data is acquired by running load tests against the Simulator for each load intensity profile. Between each load test, we copy the resulting `teastore_simulation.log` file and rename it accordingly. After acquiring a log file for each load intensity profile, we use our `ResultComparer` tool found in our Datalore notebook <<datalore_notebook>>. We recommend referring to our Datalore notebook or the snapshot archive in the Artefact Submission folder for the recommended naming and structure.

=== Validation Data
Validation data refers to a series of SQLite databases created by extracting request logs from TeaStore.

The validation data we acquired is available in our Datalore notebook <<datalore_notebook>> and in `docs/SIGSIM_PADS_2024/Artefact Submission/RAST_TeaStore_Simulation_Similarity.zip`.

Acquiring the validation data from TeaStore is a more complex process involving downloading Kieker logs, transforming them, and storing them in an SQLite database. Detailed instructions for this process can be found https://github.com/jtpgames/RAST/blob/main/docs/TeaStore/ETL.adoc[here].

The validation data is acquired similarly to the prediction data: running a load test, creating a database, and repeating for each load intensity profile. Again, we recommend referring to our Datalore notebook or the snapshot archive for the recommended structure.

== Artefact Submission Inventory

This describes the contents of the folder `docs/SIGSIM_PADS_2024/Artefact Submission`.

* RAST_TeaStore_Simulation_Similarity.zip: Exported Datalore notebook snapshot 21.05.2024. The folder `TeaStoreResultComparisonData` includes both the Validation Data and Prediction Data we used in our paper (the datalore notebook contains a greater set of Prediction Data for models we did not mention in our paper).
* similarity_scores.csv: File created from the ResultComparer Python script found in our Datalore notebook.
* similarity_scores.ods: File created from the similarity_scores.csv file using LibreOffice. Includes all formulas to assess the experimental results as well as the figures found in the paper. Also includes results and figures not found in the paper.
* Figures: Includes all figures generated using the similarity_scores.ods file and published in the paper.
* Tables: Includes tables published in the paper relevant for reproduction.
* Folder Configuration_1: Contains the result of running the instructions in Section <<_workflow_for_acquiring_data_for_similarity_comparison>> with <<_configuration_1>>.
* Folder Configuration_2: Contains the result of running the instructions in Section <<_workflow_for_acquiring_data_for_similarity_comparison>> with <<_configuration_2>>.
* Folder Configuration_3: Contains the result of running the instructions in Section <<_workflow_for_acquiring_data_for_similarity_comparison>> with <<_configuration_3>>.
* Folder Configuration_4: Contains the result of running the instructions in Section <<_workflow_for_acquiring_data_for_similarity_comparison>> with <<_configuration_4>>.

== Article Claims
The article has the following claims:

* C1: RAST is able to produce ridge and decision tree regression models for TeaStore with very high R² scores (> 0.9)
* C2: Regardless of the model and correction value used, the similarity values consistently decrease as the load intensity increases.
* C3: Performing the correction loop in the Simulator leads to lower similarity values.
* C4: The ridge regression model consistently outperforms the decision tree model in terms of similarity values across all request types.
* C5: The Load Tester is able to consistently generate the same workload, i.e., generate a consistent count and sequence of requests in every execution of the load test

To verify the claims, perform the full experiment according to the <<_instructions_for_conducting_experiments>>.

The mapping between claims, figures and tables are as follows (original figures and tables are located in `docs/SIGSIM_PADS_2024/Artefact Submission`:

[#_instructions_for_conducting_experiments]
== Instructions for Conducting Experiments

To conduct the experiments outlined in this paper, please follow the step-by-step instructions below:

=== System Requirements

To enhance the reliability of our experimental results and ensure they robustly support our claims, we conducted the experiments across various hardware and software configurations. The specific configurations utilized by the authors include:
[#_configuration_1]
==== Configuration 1
* CPU: Intel® Core™ i5-1135G7 @ 2.40GHz × 8
* RAM: 16GB
* OS: Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS 64-bit (_newer OS versions are untested_)

Packages to install (use `sudo apt-get install X` where `X` is the name of the following packages):

* curl
* git
* docker-compose (we used version 1.29.2)
* docker (we used version 27.2.0)
* python3.12-venv
* python3.12-dev
* openjdk-11-jre-headless
* maven (we used version 3.6.3)
* screen

With the following command, all packages can be installed at once:
[source]
----
sudo apt-get install unzip curl git docker-compose docker python3.12-venv python3.12-dev openjdk-11-jre-headless maven screen make gcc g++
----

[#_configuration_2]
==== Configuration 2 (reported in the paper)
Virtual machine running on Configuration 1 with

* CPU: 6 vCPUs
* RAM: 8GB
* OS: Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS 64-bit

using python 3.10 instead of 3.12 and docker version 24.0.7.

[source]
----
sudo apt-get install unzip curl git docker-compose docker python3.10-venv python3.10-dev openjdk-11-jre-headless maven screen make gcc g++
----

[#_configuration_3]
==== Configuration 3
Virtual machine running with

* CPU: 16 vCPUs
* RAM: 32GB
* OS: Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS 64-bit

on the following hardware:

* CPU: 2x Intel® Xeon® Processor E5-2690 @ 2,90 GHz × 8

The software configuration is the same as in <<_configuration_2>>.

[#_configuration_4]
==== Configuration 4

* CPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R) E-2278G CPU @ 3.40GHz × 16
* RAM: 32GB
* OS: Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS 64-bit

The software configuration is the same as in <<_configuration_2>>.

[IMPORTANT]
Because this machine has a lot more processing power that the other configurations, the load intensities as specified in this repository are not enough to generate a meaningful load for TeaStore. As a result, the variance in recorded processing times is very low. This leads to the predictor variables having minimal influence on the processing times in the training data. To overcome this, it is possible to scale the load up by setting the `LOAD_SCALING_FACTOR` variable in the file `locust_scripts/locust/official_teastore_locustfile.py`.
For the results uploaded to this repository, we set `LOAD_SCALING_FACTOR = 15.0` Additionally, we set the `TIME_SCALING_FACTOR` variable to `3.0` because using such a high load intensity causes the amount of users to spawn per second (which is 100 per recommendation of the locust developers) to be lower than the amount required by the load intensity profile.
The r^2 scores of the resulting models are still not within our desired range. The problem is that the process running the load tester is fully utilizing one core and in its current version, it is not possible to run the load test across multiple operating system processes. Thus, the load tester is still not able to generate enough load to meaningfully put the TeaStore under enough load. We keep these results for reference but argue that this is a problem regarding training data acquisition on this specific machine and not a general problem of the RAST approach.

=== System settings

[NOTE]
If you use a non-root user on your machine, follow the instructions here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user to use docker as a non-root user.

To allow establishing tens of thousands of TCP connections during a load test, we adjust some settings of the operating system. In the following, the settings are shown for the Ubuntu OS.

==== Limits
The following settings allow the operating system to open a greater amount of so-called file descriptors. File descriptors are required to open files or network sockets.

* Make sure the following line is present in */etc/pam.d/common-session*: `session required pam_limits.so`
* Make sure the following line is present in */etc/pam.d/common-session-noninteractive*: `session required pam_limits.so`
* Add a new line in */etc/security/limits.conf*: `<username> soft nofile 50000`
* Reboot

Verify that the limits are correctly set.
Our limits are:
----
~$ ulimit -Sn
50000
~$ ulimit -Hn
1048576

----

==== TCP settings

* Add the following lines in /etc/sysctl.conf:
[source]
----
# Default settings:
# sudo sysctl -a | grep net.core.som
#   net.core.somaxconn = 4096
# sudo sysctl -a | grep netdev_max
#   net.core.netdev_max_backlog = 1000
# sudo sysctl -a | grep tcp_max_syn
#   net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog = 512
# sudo sysctl -a | grep tcp_tw_reuse
#  net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse = 2
# sudo sysctl -a | grep tcp_fin_timeout
#   net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout = 60
# sudo sysctl -a | grep local_port_range
#   net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 32768    60999

# Source: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/max-number-of-concurrent-tcp-connections-to-droplet

net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 1024 61000
net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout = 30
net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse = 1
# net.core.somaxconn = 4096

[#_workflow_for_acquiring_data_for_similarity_comparison]
=== Workflow for acquiring data for similarity comparison.

First, download the RAST repository from Zenodo. In a bash you can use the following command:
[source,sh]
----
wget https://zenodo.org/records/13955733/files/RAST.zip?download=1 -O RAST.zip
----

[NOTE]
The id in the URL refers to the specific version of the artefact. Make sure that you use the latest version found in the Zenodo repository because the version given in the command here might be outdated.

==== Automated (Recommended)

We recommend using the tmux tool when running experiments on remote machines accessed via ssh.This allows you to maintain persistent sessions, even if the connection drops.

To install tmux on Ubuntu, run:

[source,sh]
----
sudo apt install tmux
----

Once installed, instead of running your script directly in the terminal, start a tmux session by typing:

[source,sh]
----
tmux
----

Inside the session, you can run your script as usual. If your connection is interrupted, the session and script will continue running in the background. To reconnect to the session after reconnecting via SSH, use:
[source,sh]
----
tmux attach
----

You can also detach from a session at any time without stopping your script by pressing `Ctrl-b` followed by `d`. This allows you to safely disconnect from SSH and return later without losing your work.

This section describes the necessary steps to prepare the experiment and execute it up to the point of acquiring all necessary data for similarity comparison (see <<_similarity_comparison>>).
All steps described in the following are automatically performed by typing the following in a terminal:
[source,sh]
----
cd <RAST directory>/Automations
./setup_and_create_all_data_for_similarity_comparison.sh
----

Help message:
....
This script sets up and executes an experiment with RAST using TeaStore. The execution of the experiment takes approximately 1-2 hours.
At the end of the script, the calculated similarities between TeaStore and RAST's Simulator are stored in the file: Similarity_Comparison/similarity_scores.csv

Usage: ./setup_and_create_all_data_for_similarity_comparison.sh [OPTION]

Options:
  -c, --clean-start    Remove result directories and files before starting.
                       This results in a fresh start of the experiment, ensuring no previous data interferes.
  -h, --help           Display this help message and exit.
....

At the end, the script prints all functions that it executed and the time it required. One example for a final output looks like this:
....
Function                                 Time Taken
run_setup                                00:00:53

.Instructions
[%collapsible]
====

. Open your terminal and use a terminal multiplexer such as tmux to create four sessions. We will refer to these sessions by numbers:
    * Session (1): This session will be used to start the TeaStore or the Simulator. Navigate to the respective folder within the cloned repositories.
    * Session (2): This session will be used to start the Load Test. Navigate to the `locust_scripts` folder.
    * Session (3): This session will be used to make code changes to the `offical_teastore_locustfile.py` file, allowing you to modify the load intensity profile. 
      Navigate to the `locust_scripts/locust` folder and open the file using a text editor of your choice (e.g., Vim or Emacs).
    * Session (4): This session will be used to make code changes to the `teastore.kt` file, enabling you to modify the predictive model. 
      Navigate to the Simulators folder and open the file.
. In Session (1), start the TeaStore or the Simulator based on the measurements you wish to acquire.
   For the purpose of this explanation, we will focus on starting the Simulator. 
   Navigate to your local Simulator folder and execute the command `./gradlew run`. 
   If successful, you will see the following line printed on the console: `INFO ktor.application - Responding at http://0.0.0.0:8081`. 
   To terminate the Simulator, press `Ctrl + C`.
. In Session (2):
..  (Recommended):
...     Create a python virtual environment in a directory called `venv`, e.g., `python3 -m venv venv`
...     Run the command `source activate_venv.sh` to activate the Python virtual environment (venv).
...     Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
..  Execute `./start_teastore_loadtest.sh` to initiate the load test.
    This repository uses a low load intensity by default.
    The load test will automatically conclude after approximately two minutes.
..  Clean the folder by executing `./delete_results.sh`.
. In Session (4), you can now examine the `teastore_simulation.log` file.
  This file contains simulated processing times generated by the predictive model, among other relevant information.
. To modify the load intensity profile,
  navigate to Session (3) and locate the `StagesShape` class within the `offical_teastore_locustfile.py` file.
  Look for the line `load_intensity_profile: LoadIntensityProfile = LoadIntensityProfile.LOW`.
  Set `load_intensity_profile` to your desired value.
. To modify the predictive model,
  navigate to Session (4) and follow the instructions in the README.md file within the Simulators repository.

[#_similarity_comparison]
=== Similarity Comparison
==== Workflow

To perform a similarity comparison, two types of datasets are required: prediction data and validation data.

*Prediction Data:* This consists of log files generated by the Simulator.

*Validation Data:* This consists of SQLite databases created by extracting request logs from TeaStore.

Both the Simulator and TeaStore undergo identical load tests to ensure consistency in the comparison.

After acquiring the datasets, the `ResultComparer` is used to determine their similarity. The `ResultComparer` generates a `similarity_scores.csv` file. To facilitate easier analysis of this data, we provide an *.ods file where you can import the contents. This file constructs the figures published in our paper. Follow these steps to import the *.csv file (assuming you have followed our automated workflow to acquire the `similarity_scores.csv` file):

. Open the `Similarity_Comparison/template_similarity_scores.ods` file <<step_1>>.
. Open the `Similarity_Comparison/similarity_scores.csv` file and copy all its contents to the clipboard (Ctrl + A, Ctrl + C) <<step_2>>.
. Open the `InputFromCsv` sheet in the .ods file, select columns A to E, and paste the contents from the clipboard (Ctrl + V). The Text Import dialog will open. Press OK to complete the import <<step_3>>.
. You can find the figures on the `similarity_scores` sheet.

[#_instructions_for_adapting]
== Instructions for Adapting RAST for other systems
RAST can be adapted to different request-response based systems. Adapting RAST involves a series of steps depending on the system, the log files it generates, and the network API is serves. Adapting RAST usually involves programmatic extensions, like the implementation of Python scripts that convert log files and Kotlin files that simulate the system's network API.

* How to integrate log files of other systems is explained in xref:../ETL/README.adoc[ETL_README] (`docs/ETL/README.adoc`)
* How to implement a simulator that implements the system's network API is explained in xref:../../Simulators/README.adoc[README of Simulators Repository] (`Simulators/README.adoc`)
